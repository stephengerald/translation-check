# Security

## Controls reviewed

- The contract pins the concrete GenVM runner `py-genlayer:1jb45aa8ynh2a9c9xn3b7qqh8sm5q93hwfp7jqmwsfhh8jpz09h6`.
- User text, identifiers, arrays, and lifecycle counts are bounded.
- Role and phase checks reject unauthorized or repeated transitions.
- Model input is framed as untrusted evidence; output is restricted to fixed enums or exact-length bitmasks.
- Validator replay recomputes the decision instead of trusting a leader-only answer.
- No private key, wallet file, secret, production credential, token custody, or GEN transfer exists in the repository.

## Threats and limitations

Only the source segment, required terms, submitted translation, language labels, and fixed standard are judged. The contract performs no dictionary or web lookup.

This is not certified legal, medical, or safety-critical translation review. Dialect choice, specialized terminology, and cultural suitability still need qualified human review.

On-chain text is public and permanent. Frontends must warn users not to submit secrets, personal identifiers, or confidential evidence. A value-bearing or regulated deployment needs a separate threat model, authenticated sources, operational appeals, and an audited settlement adapter.

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately to the repository owner. Do not place exploit details in a public issue before coordinated review.
